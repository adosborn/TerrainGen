# TerrainGen
Final project for CSCI 237 a computer graphics course at Williams College I took fall 2022
The project was posed as an open ended exploration of concepts that were studied during the course
I decided to code a flexable, pseudoradom terrain generator using an implimentation of perlin noise
The majority of my code can be found in HW.cpp
